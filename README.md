### API Docs

Boards API docs can be found over at <https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/blob/main/server/swagger/docs/html/index.html>

### Getting started

Our [developer guide](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/focalboard/personal-server-setup-guide) has detailed instructions on how to set up your development environment for the **Personal Server**. You can also join the [~Focalboard community channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/focalboard) to connect with other developers.

Clone [mattermost-server](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server) into sibling directory.

Create an `.env` file in the focalboard directory that contains:

```
EXCLUDE_ENTERPRISE="1"
```

To build the server:

```
make prebuild
make
```

To run the server:

```
 ./bin/focalboard-server
```

Then navigate your browser to [`http://localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000) to access your Focalboard server. The port is configured in `config.json`.

Once the server is running, you can rebuild just the web app via `make webapp` in a separate terminal window. Reload your browser to see the changes.

### Building and running standalone desktop apps

You can build standalone apps that package the server to run locally against SQLite:

  * Open a `git-bash` prompt.
  * Run `make prebuild`
  * The above prebuild step needs to be run only when you make changes to or want to install your npm dependencies, etc.
  * Once the prebuild is completed, you can keep repeating the below steps to build the app & see the changes.
  * Run `make win-wpf-app`
  * Run `cd win-wpf/msix && focalboard.exe`
